### :wave: I’m Jenn Junod, it’s lovely to meet you!

As someone who thrives on human connection, I advocate for those who have gone unheard. My passion and experience create a space where people can come together, be it learning live, hosting [Shit2TalkAbout](https://shit2talkabout.com), or being a [Developcado](https://dev.to/jennjunod/series/19669).

I am a developcado (Developer Advocate), speaker, podcast host, and live streamer. 

### :thinking: What is Teach Jenn Tech? 

I stream anywhere from once to four times per week Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,  & Friday, learning about tech that a guest wants to teach me. Since launching in July 2022, the focus has been Python, TypeScript, & JavaScript with a sprinkle of APIs, and a splash of databases.
